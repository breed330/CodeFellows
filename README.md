###Notes on exercises:
####General comments

This was the first time I dabbled into these technologies (JQuery, Python, Django). This was fun to do. However, I would not call this production-ready code. :) It is quite strange to display such 'green' coding. But that is the point of the exercises. I look forward to learning best-practices for each of these!
